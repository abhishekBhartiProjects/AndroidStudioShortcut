# AndroidStudioShortcut
These are some of the most used shortcuts of Android Studio. Most of these shortcuts are default shortcuts in Android Studio.

## Easiest
- **⌘ + ,** → open preferences
- **⌘ + W** → close current tab
- **⌘ + L** → jump to a line number you specify. Use this command, type a number, hit enter
- **⌘ + E** → go back to a file you recently had open. Use this command, then hit enter to go back to the last file you were in. 

**Extra tip:** You can also keep ⌘ held down, and repeatedly hit E (↓ / ↑) or use to go back further, then hit enter
- **⌥ + ←** → hold down ⌥ and tap ← to move your cursor over words. Same with moving to the →
- **⌥ + delete** → hold down ⌥ and keep tapping delete to delete per word
- **⌘ + ←** → hold down ⌘ and click ← to move your cursor all the way to the left. Same with moving to the →
- **⌘ + delete** → hold down ⌘ and keep tapping delete to delete entire lines

**Extra tip:** You can also just use ⌘ + X, especially if you’re wanting to move a line since that cuts the line, and ⌘ + V will paste a line
- **⌘ + ⌥ + L** → automatically formats the highlighted code (or the entire file, if you have nothing highlighted)
- **⌥ + ↑** → hold down ⌥ and keep pressing ↑ to highlight in an increasing scope. You can use ↓ to unhighlight

## More Difficult
These will help you navigate around your app and help you find whatever you need in your project.
- **shift + ⌘ + O** → type a file name and hit enter to jump there.

**Extra tip:** if you’re wanting to jump to **HomeActivity.kt**, just type **HA.kt** and hit enter

- **shift + ⌘ + F** → search for specific syntax with this. Maybe you’re looking for a spot where you typed .inflate, but you can’t quite remember where you used it. **shift + ⌘ + F** will find it for you. If I’m not jumping to a specific class, I always use this to find what I’m looking for.

**Extra tip:** use the ↓ to scroll to the exact one you want, then hit enter to jump there.
