# AndroidStudioShortcut
These are some of the most used shortcuts of Android Studio. Most of these shortcuts are default shortcuts in Android Studio.

## Easiest
- **⌘ + ,** → open preferences
- **⌘ + W** → close current tab
- **⌘ + L** → jump to a line number you specify. Use this command, type a number, hit enter
- **⌘ + E** → go back to a file you recently had open. Use this command, then hit enter to go back to the last file you were in. 

**Extra tip:** You can also keep ⌘ held down, and repeatedly hit E (↓ / ↑) or use to go back further, then hit enter
- **⌥ + ←** → hold down ⌥ and tap ← to move your cursor over words. Same with moving to the →
- **⌥ + delete** → hold down ⌥ and keep tapping delete to delete per word
- **⌘ + ←** → hold down ⌘ and click ← to move your cursor all the way to the left. Same with moving to the →
- **⌘ + delete** → hold down ⌘ and keep tapping delete to delete entire lines

**Extra tip:** You can also just use ⌘ + X, especially if you’re wanting to move a line since that cuts the line, and ⌘ + V will paste a line
- **⌘ + ⌥ + L** → automatically formats the highlighted code (or the entire file, if you have nothing highlighted)
- **⌥ + ↑** → hold down ⌥ and keep pressing ↑ to highlight in an increasing scope. You can use ↓ to unhighlight

## More Difficult
These will help you navigate around your app and help you find whatever you need in your project.
- **shift + ⌘ + O** → type a file name and hit enter to jump there.

**Extra tip:** if you’re wanting to jump to **HomeActivity.kt**, just type **HA.kt** and hit enter

- **shift + ⌘ + F** → search for specific syntax with this. Maybe you’re looking for a spot where you typed .inflate, but you can’t quite remember where you used it. **shift + ⌘ + F** will find it for you. If I’m not jumping to a specific class, I always use this to find what I’m looking for.

**Extra tip:** use the ↓ to scroll to the exact one you want, then hit enter to jump there.

- **⌥ + F12** → open or close terminal inside of Android Studio. One of my favorites
- **shift + F6** → rename a variable / method / class name. Click in the middle of what you want to rename, then use this shortcut. When you’re done renaming, you’ll need to hit enter two times
- **shift + ⌘ + ]** → move to the tab to the right
- **shift + ⌘ + [** → move to the tab to the left

- **⌥ + ⌥** → press ⌥, then press ⌥ a second time and hold it down. Then, hit the down arrow key a few times ↓ while still holding ⌥. Let go of both at the same time. Now type on multiple lines! Hit esc to get out of this mode
- **⌥ + ⌘ + B** → have your cursor on the method being called, and then use this command. This is particularly useful if you’re utilizing interfaces. You can either go to the interface declaration, or the implementation. Most of the time we’ll want to jump to the implementation to see the actual code.

**Extra tip:** you can also hold down ⌘ and then click on the method to jump to the implementation of it. It will jump you to the interface declaration, however, if you have one, which is why I use ⌥ + ⌘ + B

- **⌘ + /** → highlight a block of code, then use this shortcut to comment all of it out.
- **⌘ + shift + A** → Find an action. If you know the name of an action in Android Studio, use this shortcut, type the action in, hit enter, bam.

## Debugging
- **shift + ⌘ + F8** → look at all the breakpoints you have mapped

**Extra tip:** After using this command, use ⌘ + A, and then press delete to delete all of your breakpoints. I do this all the time.

- **F8** → step over — go to the next line of code
- **F7** → step into — literally step into the method / class highlighted
- **shift + F8** → step out — literally step out back to where you were before
- **⌥ + ⌘ + R** → resume program
