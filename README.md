These are some of the most used shortcuts of Android Studio. Most of these shortcuts are default shortcuts in Android Studio.

## Easiest
- **⌘ + ,** → open preferences
- **⌘ + W** → close current tab
- **⌘ + L** → jump to a line number you specify. Use this command, type a number, hit enter
- **⌘ + E** → go back to a file you recently had open. Use this command, then hit enter to go back to the last file you were in. 

**Extra tip:** You can also keep ⌘ held down, and repeatedly hit E (↓ / ↑) or use to go back further, then hit enter
- **⌥ + ←** → hold down ⌥ and tap ← to move your cursor over words. Same with moving to the →
- **⌥ + delete** → hold down ⌥ and keep tapping delete to delete per word
- **⌘ + ←** → hold down ⌘ and click ← to move your cursor all the way to the left. Same with moving to the →
- **⌘ + delete** → hold down ⌘ and keep tapping delete to delete entire lines

**Extra tip:** You can also just use ⌘ + X, especially if you’re wanting to move a line since that cuts the line, and ⌘ + V will paste a line
- **⌘ + ⌥ + L** → automatically formats the highlighted code (or the entire file, if you have nothing highlighted)
- **⌥ + ↑** → hold down ⌥ and keep pressing ↑ to highlight in an increasing scope. You can use ↓ to unhighlight
